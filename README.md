# VanityGPT-API-Examples
How to use and integrate the Vanity GPT API

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

There are no packages or libraries that need to be installed to call the Vanity GPT API. 
We have tried to make everything as simple as possible, offering only a few calls and parameters to ensure you get the responses you expect.

You will however need to obtain a API Key with you can apply for on our <a href="https://api.vanitygpt.com/" alt="" target="_blank">application page</a>


### Prerequisites

The only pre-requisites to use the api examples are having the language requirements instsalled for each example. e.g. PHP for the php example.
The API calls can be made from both client and server setups.
